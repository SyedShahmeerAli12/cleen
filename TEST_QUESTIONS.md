# Cleen AI Skincare Assistant - Test Questions

## ðŸŽ¯ **Challenging Test Questions by User Segment**

### **1. Science-First Enthusiasts (Most Difficult)**

#### **Question 1: Complex Ingredient Interactions**
```
"I'm using 0.025% tretinoin nightly and want to add azelaic acid 20% for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. What does the research say about combining these actives? Should I layer them or alternate? What about pH considerations and potential irritation?"
```

#### **Question 2: Clinical Trial Analysis**
```
"What peer-reviewed studies demonstrate the efficacy of combining niacinamide with azelaic acid for treating adult hormonal acne, and what are the optimal concentrations based on clinical trial data? Include mechanism of action and side effect profiles."
```

#### **Question 3: Formulation Science**
```
"I'm comparing three different benzoyl peroxide formulations: 2.5% gel, 5% cream, and 10% wash-off. Based on clinical studies, which formulation has the best efficacy-to-irritation ratio for sensitive skin, and what's the scientific rationale?"
```

### **2. Busy Professionals (Time-Constrained)**

#### **Question 4: Complex Lifestyle Integration**
```
"I'm a 35-year-old executive with stress-induced acne flare-ups, traveling 3 days a week, working 12-hour days, and dealing with jet lag. What evidence-based, time-efficient routine can I follow that won't interfere with my schedule and works across different time zones?"
```

#### **Question 5: Multi-Constraint Problem**
```
"I'm a 28-year-old lawyer with hormonal acne, sensitive skin, and I'm pregnant. I need a routine that's safe for pregnancy, effective for acne, gentle for sensitive skin, and takes less than 5 minutes twice daily. What does the research recommend?"
```

### **3. Men's Skincare Beginners (Complex Cases)**

#### **Question 6: Multi-Issue Resolution**
```
"I'm a 32-year-old man who's never used skincare products. I have acne on my face, razor burn on my neck, and ingrown hairs on my jawline. I shave daily for work and work out 5 times a week. What's the minimal routine that addresses all these issues without making me look 'overdone'?"
```

#### **Question 7: Lifestyle Integration**
```
"As a 25-year-old man who works construction (outdoor, sweaty), what skincare routine can I follow that works with my daily shaving, handles sun exposure, prevents breakouts from sweat, and fits into my 10-minute morning routine?"
```

### **4. Post-Acne Healers (Recovery Complexity)**

#### **Question 8: Complex Recovery Protocol**
```
"After completing a 6-month isotretinoin course, I have compromised skin barrier, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and some scarring. I'm also prone to new breakouts. What scientifically-proven ingredients should I use to repair my skin barrier while preventing new acne and fading marks? Include layering order and timing."
```

#### **Question 9: Multi-Active Management**
```
"I'm using 0.05% tretinoin for anti-aging and have post-acne marks. I want to add vitamin C and niacinamide. What does the research say about combining these three actives? What's the optimal layering sequence, timing, and concentration for each?"
```

### **5. Acne-Prone Consumers (Complex Cases)**

#### **Question 10: Treatment Resistance**
```
"My 16-year-old daughter has tried benzoyl peroxide 2.5%, salicylic acid 2%, adapalene 0.1%, and oral antibiotics but still gets painful cystic acne on her chin and jawline. Her skin is sensitive and gets irritated easily. What does the latest research say about alternative treatments that won't damage her skin barrier?"
```

#### **Question 11: Multi-Factor Analysis**
```
"I'm 24, have combination skin, hormonal acne that flares before my period, and I'm on birth control. I also have mild rosacea. What routine addresses both acne and rosacea without making either condition worse? Include ingredient interactions and timing considerations."
```

### **6. Cross-Segment Complex Questions**

#### **Question 12: Multi-Domain Synthesis**
```
"What does the current dermatology literature say about the relationship between gut microbiome, hormonal acne in adult women, and the efficacy of topical treatments versus systemic approaches? Include mechanism of action and treatment protocols."
```

#### **Question 13: Advanced Treatment Planning**
```
"I'm a 30-year-old woman with persistent adult acne, melasma, and early signs of aging. I want to use retinoids, hydroquinone, and chemical peels. What does the research say about combining these treatments safely? Include timing, sequencing, and monitoring protocols."
```

#### **Question 14: Complex Skin Analysis**
```
"I have oily T-zone, dry cheeks, sensitive skin, hormonal acne, and I'm starting to see fine lines. I also have post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous breakouts. What evidence-based routine addresses all these concerns without causing irritation or making any condition worse?"
```
